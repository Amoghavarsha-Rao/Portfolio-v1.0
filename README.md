<h1>React+Vite Portfolio Website</h1>

<p>
  This project is an <strong>iterative build</strong> based on my previous portfolio design, which can be found in the repository <a href="https://github.com/username/my-reactfolio"><strong>My Reactfolio</strong></a>. For this version, I've focused on building most of the components from scratch, leveraging <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> to improve the design, maintainability, and overall performance of the site.
</p>

<h2>Key Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Built from Scratch:</strong> A significant portion of this iteration has been re-written with custom components, without relying on third-party templates or excessive pre-built code.</li>
  <li><strong>Tailwind CSS Utilization:</strong> Proper and efficient use of <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for responsive and consistent styling across the entire site, minimizing CSS bloat and ensuring easy scalability.</li>
  <li><strong>Refined Design:</strong> Updated UI/UX to provide a more polished look and feel, while maintaining a simple and elegant design. All styling now adheres to the project's design principles for clarity and consistency.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimized Animations:</strong> Custom animations for buttons, icons, and interactive elements have been built using CSS and React state to enhance user experience without causing performance issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Better Code Structure:</strong> The codebase has been organized to make it more maintainable, following a component-based approach with better readability, proper folder structures, and improved naming conventions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Fully responsive layout using Tailwind's grid and flex utilities to ensure the site looks great across all device sizes.</li>
  <li><strong>CV Download Button:</strong> An animated, interactive button that allows visitors to download my CV directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Links with Animation:</strong> Icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email are animated on hover, creating an engaging user interaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Technologies Used Section:</strong> Highlighting key technologies used in my projects, represented with animated icons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible Suggestions for Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accessibility Enhancements:</strong> While the website looks good, focusing on making the site more accessible (e.g., improving contrast, keyboard navigation, adding ARIA roles) would be beneficial for users with disabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>SEO Optimization:</strong> Implementing better SEO practices, including meta tags, descriptions, and Open Graph tags to improve visibility in search engines.</li>
  <li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Adding a toggle for dark mode to enhance the user experience for those who prefer it.</li>
  <li><strong>More Projects Section:</strong> It might be good to include a more detailed showcase of projects with case studies, screenshots, and technology stacks.</li>
